   The setup.py is used for local installation during development. It just installs
   the *.py files in src/ when invoked by CMake and not skbuild. It relies on CMake
   to copy over the pybind11 library to the site-packages.
   
   To build a distributable PyPi package, invoke skbuild from the top-level
   directory instead e.g.:
       python3 -m pip wheel /some/dir --wheel-dir /another/dir --no-deps
