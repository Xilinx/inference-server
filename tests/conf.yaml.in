#* This configuration file defines specific variables that are needed by some
#* tests but cannot be hard-coded in the test(s) itself because they will vary
#* depending on who's running the tests.

#* The easiest way to use this file is to duplicate it in this directory and
#* rename it "conf.yaml". By default, the test script will look for a
#* configuration file with that name here so you don't need to do anything more
#* but you can also specify a custom path to the config file using the
#* --runtime-config flag to pytest.
