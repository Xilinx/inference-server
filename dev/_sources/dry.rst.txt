..* This page has blocks of text that are inserted in multiple pages in an
..* effort to avoid duplicating text and making the documentation easier to
..* maintain. The format for text snippets is:
..*     +<label>
..*     <contents>
..*     -<label>
..* As an arbitrary convention, I'm using +/- prefixes to denote start and stop
..* labels. Note that due to how including sections of pages works in RST, the
..* labels must be entirely unique i.e. if you use "foobar" as a label, you
..* cannot use "foobar" at the start of any other label. Therefore, prefer
..* verbose labels to prevent unintentional matching.
